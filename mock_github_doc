# GitHub for the Rest of Us (No Coding Required)

If you aren't a software engineer, opening GitHub for the first time can feel like walking into the cockpit of an airplane. There are buttons everywhere, half the screen is in a language you don't speak, and you might be afraid of breaking something. 

Take a deep breath. Here is the secret: for what we need to do, **GitHub is basically just Google Drive with a really good "Undo" button.**

This guide will show you how to read, edit, and save documents on GitHub without touching a line of code or downloading a single app.

## What You Need Before We Start
* A free account on GitHub.com.
* A web browser.
* About five minutes. 

## The Jargon Translator
Developers love making simple things sound complicated. Before we click anything, let's translate the three most common words you'll see:

* **Repository (or "Repo"):** This is just a project folder. That's it. It holds all the text files and images for a specific project.
* **Commit:** This is developer-speak for "Save." When you make a change, you "commit" it to the project's history. 
* **Branch:** Think of this as a "Rough Draft." Instead of editing the official, live document, you create a branch. You make all your messy edits on your branch, and when it looks perfect, you ask to merge it into the official version.

## Step 1: Find the file you want to edit
First, we need to locate the document you want to change. Editing is easier than starting from scratch.

In the search bar, type "open source documentation" for example. Find a document ending with .md, meaning markdown.

## Step 2: Click the magic pencil
You don't need to download this file to edit it. You can do it right here on the webpage.

1. Look at the top right corner of the document.
2. Click the icon that looks like a **small pencil**.
3. You will be asked to fork the document before you edit. *This just means to make a personal copy of it*.  
4. The screen will change into an editing box. You can now type, delete, and fix typos just like you would in Microsoft Word or Google Doc!

## Step 3: Tell GitHub what you changed ("Commit changes")
When you are done typing, you need to save your work. In GitHub, you don't just click "Save." You have to leave a tiny sticky note explaining *what* you saved so your team knows what happened.
Even if you're working alone at the moment, it's a good practice to commit as if you were part of a team.

1. At the top right, click **Commit changes** box.
2. In the "Propose changes" box, write a short, clear summary in the "Commit message" section. (Example: *"Fixed a typo in the second paragraph."*)
3. Add a description of the changes in the "Extended description" field (optional).
3. Click the big green **Commit changes** / **Propose changes** button.

You just made your first GitHub edit!
